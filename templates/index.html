<h1>Welcome to the free VAT submittor</h1>

<h2>What does this website do?</h2>
<p>It logs you into the HMRC VAT system, and then submits a spreadsheet (which must be in a particular format) as your VAT return.</p>

<p>It is built on top of the work done by Seb Bacon and I have just added the small changes to ensure that code picks up data from CSV for all fields required for VAT submission of non flat rate scheme submitters.</p>
<p>The changes I have done on this software are for my own use.  It is free to use and made available under <a href="/tandc">this License</a>.</p>
<p>Using this website indicates your agreement with that licence, specifically that it is provided without warranty of any kind.</p>

<h3> Words below are from original author Seb and I agree 100%.</h3>

<h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
<p>Until April 2019, someone with very simple VAT arrangements could do a return by pasting two numbers from a spreadsheet into a form provided by HMRC.</p>
<p>Now, under their "Making Things Digital" programme, this is no longer possible: you have to evaluate, pay for and use third party commercial software to do your return.</p>
<p>On principle, I don't think you should be forced to pay money to do your tax return. And in practice, I don't want to evaluate a load of different services which may or may not be safe to use. It's actually easier and safer to write my own.</p>

<h2>Is this software safe to use?</h2>
<p>I've only made it for my own use, but it should work for anyone.</p>
<p>The software doesn't record ANY personal info (<a href="/privacy">more here</a>).  
  You just have to make a spreadsheet in a particular format, and make it available as a CSV online. 
  I did it using data imported from MySQL database into Google Sheets. 
  If you can't work it out, <a href="mailto:ank.mittal@gmail.com">drop me a line</a> and I'll try and assist the best I can.</p>
<p>The software is Open Source and source code is <a href-"https://github.com/pubmania/vatreturn">available on Github</a>. The original source code from Seb is also <a href="https://github.com/sebbacon/vatreturn">available on Github</a></p>

<p>It then takes the spreadsheet and submits it to HMRC for you.</p>
